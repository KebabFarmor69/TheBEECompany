        <h1>Our Legacy</h1>
        <p>Milk and honey were taken over in
             2016 by Honey and Mr. Honey, men 
             have been driving since the summer
              of 2020 only by Mr Honey. 
              We at Milk and Sweetheart always 
              have the customer in the greatest 
              focus and work hard to provide a 
              personal service, where we get the 
              chance to inspire and help our 
              customers according to their needs. 
              It is with great love and passion 
              that we hand-pick our collections 
              and a carefully selected range from 
              leading brands. </p>

                It all started as a 
              small shop providing quality skincare
               products in refilled bottles and
                with the belief that business could
                 be a force for good and the world
                  - our source of beauty.
              Since then The BEE Company (STICKY) has become
               a global retail business serving over 30 
               million customers worldwide, employs 10,000 
               people with a further 12,000 in our
                franchise team, and operates in around
                 3,000 stores in more than 70 countries.
              We have exported innovative products, 
              campaigns that matter and an ethical approach
               to business all over the globe.

              We couldn’t have done any of this
               without our inspirational people and their 
               commercial instincts. Bees are highly adaptable and could survive in all corners of the world if only flowers were available.
               That is why bees have existed on our earth for millions of years even before human times.
               Beekeeping is something we humans have 
               been doing for a long time. Bees are 
               probably man's oldest domestic animals, 
               and evidence of this in the form of honey 
               and bees, we have found both in the tombs
                of the pharaohs in Egypt and in cave
                 paintings around the world. Honey has 
                 been used as a natural medicine, for 
                 its antibacterial properties and healing
                  power. Today we have about 100 bee 
                  communities in our apiaries. Our plan 
                  is to gradually increase the number of
                   communities. The bee variety we work 
                   with is called Buckfast and originates
                    from southwest England. We raise our
                     own queens to gain better control over
                      our bee colonies. It gives productive 
                      queens with good qualities, which 
                      gives us a good harvest of honey.
